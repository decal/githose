**Things To Do**
============

* Rename *gitaa* to *gitset* (Dipset Diplomats!)

* Fix inc/setup to declare *setup_cpu_cores* properly..

* Command-line arguments..
  1. Pass global `getopt` flags to *gitset* 
  2. Pass local `getopt` flags to *git* and *gist* bash

* Write *xaa* script to handle both *gitaa* & *gistaa*

* Finish incorporating colors into all scripts

* Continue testing `git-map-pull`

* Write scripts for other git commands such as:
  - listing repos instead of clone'ing all of them
  - listing gists instead of fork'ing all of them

* Make a Gist spider a.k.a. __spidigister__

* Turn `gitaa-color` into an _actual_ command

* Put `lib/gistaa/clone` `wget` into its own `function`

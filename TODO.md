Things To Do
============

* Write *xaa* script to handle both *gitaa* and *gistaa*
* Finish incorporating colors into all scripts
* Continue testing `git-map-pull`
* Write scripts for other git commands
* Make a Gist spider a.k.a. "spidigister"
* Turn `gitaa-color` into an _actual_ command
* Put `lib/gistaa/clone` `wget` into its own `function`
